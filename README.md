# Shopify-Technical-Challenge-Submission

I have used Node.Js, Express, MongoDb and EJs to complete the challenge.

I finished the third task which was:

"When deleting, allow deletion comments and undeletion"

To install Node.js, please follow the instructions here: https://nodejs.org/en/

Once installed, you will have npm and node binary installed in your system.

In the project directory, run npm installl

once finished, please run node server.js

and then you can view the app on http://localhost:3000
